# tkpkasmjava
Adapted from https://teachingkidsprogramming.org/.

This repository is meant to make it easier for students to download and install the TKP Java files. Once 
they have signed into their Kasm Workspace, they will be able to download the install.sh file and then
execute the script.

I have started to introduce my students to Open Source along side Ubuntu as I am trying to move away
from Windows. Because most students still run Windows, I decided it was easier to host Kasm Workspaces
on site and spin up containers that already have all required software on an Ubuntu core - no more wasting 
time trying to get software installed!
